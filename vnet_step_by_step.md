# 🚀 Workflows

# 🛠️ Workflow 1: Create basic Cloud Shell in a VNET setup
- 🗺️ Prompt the user to specify a location/region before creating a new resource group. Do not make assumptions about the location unless the user explicitly requests it.

Inside this resource group:
- 🌐 Create a VNET
- 🧩 Create 2 subnets (use default values for IP ranges)
    - 🪐 **cloudshellsubnet** (delegate container groups to this subnet)
    - 🔗 **relaysubnet**
- 📄 Create an ARM template for network profile and use cloudshellsubnet resource id in the template in current folder.
- 🏗️ Apply the network profile ARM template located in current folder.
- 📡 Create a relay namespace
- 🛡️ Give network contributor access to `6bb8e274-af5d-4df2-98a3-4fd78b4cafd9` (Azure Container Instance Service) for network profile.
- 🛡️ Give contributor access to `6bb8e274-af5d-4df2-98a3-4fd78b4cafd9` (Azure Container Instance Service) for Azure Relay.

# 🔒 Workflow 2: Add private link

> **Note:** Workflow 1 is a prerequisite for Workflow 2.

- 🔐 Create a private endpoint for relaysubnet and make sure it is integrated with a private DNS zone.
- 📝 Create A record for the relay namespace in the private DNS zone

# 💾 Workflow 3: Add a storage account

> **Note:** Workflows 1 and 2 are prerequisites for Workflow 3

- 🏦 Create a storage account
- 🧱 Create another subnet in the VNET called **storagesubnet** and add a service endpoint for storage accounts.
- 📁 Create a file share for this storage account called **testshare**

# 🌉 Workflow 4: Relay endpoint connectivity

🔍 Test net connection and lookup of relay namespace from laptop.

# 🧪 Workflow 5: Storage account access

🔎 Test nslookup of storage account from laptop and it should succeed and show a public IP.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Workflow 6: Storage behind a private endpoint

🔒 Add a private endpoint to the storage account. Test nslookup of the storage account's file endpoint from your laptop; unless private DNS integration is configured, it should still resolve to a public IP. This confirms that private endpoint DNS is not yet in effect for the file endpoint.

# 🛡️ Workflow 7: Lock down storage account

> **Note:** Workflows 3 and 6 are prerequisites for Workflow 7.

- 🚫 Lock down storage by disabling public network access

# 🧑‍💻 Workflow 8: Test connectivity of storage and relay

Create a test subnet in the VNET.

- 🖥️ Create a VM inside the test subnet (try different sizes etc to successfully create one) and inject it into the vnet to test storage connectivity. 
- 🐧 If VMs are unavailable, use a basic Ubuntu Azure Container Instance (ACI) with subnet interface reference inside the test subnet.

- ❗ If ACI creation fails due to docker registry issues, then provide some way of definitive proof.

- 🔗 Test connectivity of storage and relay endpoints.

# 🔐 Workflow 9: Lock down Azure Relay

In Azure Relay networking, disable public access. Repeat the steps in Workflow 8 to verify connectivity after disabling public access.

# 🧹 Cleanup:

- 🗑️ Delete the resource group along with all its resources, ensuring that dependencies are properly handled to avoid deletion errors.
